    "This activity is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review the key topics from each module. As you progress through the activity, the questions will get increasingly more complex. It is important that you adopt a programmer's mindset when completing this activity. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your activity, as doing so will give you a chance to fix any errors before submitting.\n",
